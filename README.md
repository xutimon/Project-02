The [data source](https://api.nobelprize.org/v1/laureate.json), (which is from [here](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets)) has a number of information on all nobel laureates in history. I decided to examine how many nobel laureates in history were men vs. women. As could be seen, the ovewehlming majority of nobel laureates have been men. This implies that women and their accomplishments continue to be underrecognized, especially in academia. 

**Key Metrics on Major Cereal Brands**

This [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals) compiled a set of key metrics for major cereal brands in the United States. I decided to see how the amount of sugar, calories, and customer satisfaction for these cereals all relate to one another. As could be seen, there is a slight increase in calories per serving when sugar per serving is increased, though this trend quickly plateaus, which surprised me. Another surprising thing I noticed was that consumer rating actually went down as the amount of sugar per serving went up, potentially indicating that consumers prefer their cereal to be less sweet.
